<p>I studied web development on my own and taught HTML, CSS and JS to schoolchildren.
Together with the team, I created a web application on React. During my work on a project, I learned how to better manage my time and work remotely. The project is stored here: https://github.com/r9fq56/samo_final.

In the future, I also plan to work remotely.
